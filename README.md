This program is a version of hangman. The program randomly chooses a word from a list. Then it draws a picture of a person with a parachute consisting of 4 rows. The player is then prompted to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it is poopulated and the picture and the word are reprinted with the guessed letters. However, if the letter that is guessed is not in the word, and line of the parachute is removed. Again the picture and the word are reprinted till the word is complete or the parachute. If either of those conditions are true the game ends.
